## 📋 Project Overview
Data-driven decision-making is the "secret sauce" for any successful restaurant chain. This project analyzes a full year of pizza sales data to uncover consumer behavior patterns, peak operational hours, and product performance.

I developed an interactive dashboard that translates raw transactional records into actionable insights, focusing on revenue growth and menu optimization.

### 🎯 Key Business Questions Addressed:
* 📉 **Sales Velocity:** Which days and hours see the highest footfall?
* 🍕 **Product Mix:** What is the distribution of sales across different pizza categories and sizes?
* 🏆 **Performance Ranking:** Which pizzas are the "Top Sellers" and which are the "Bottom 5" laggards?
* 💰 **Revenue KPIs:** What are our Average Order Value (AOV) and total revenue benchmarks?

## 📊 Executive Summary (KPIs)
Based on the analysis, the business achieved the following annual milestones:
* **Total Revenue:** $817,860.05
* **Total Orders:** 21,350
* **Total Pizzas Sold:** 49,574
* **Avg Order Value:** $38.31
* **Avg Pizzas Per Order:** 2.32

## 🏗️ Data Architecture & Workflow
The project involved data transformation and visualization techniques to ensure the dashboard was both accurate and intuitive.

### 🔧 The Workflow:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled data types, date-time parsing, and removed inconsistencies in pizza naming conventions.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created calculated measures for Sales Percentage and Volume using DAX/Excel formulas.
3. **Trend Mapping:** Segmented data into Hourly and Daily buckets to identify "Rush Hours."
4. **Visual Hierarchy:** Organized the dashboard to show high-level KPIs first, followed by granular product-level performance.
